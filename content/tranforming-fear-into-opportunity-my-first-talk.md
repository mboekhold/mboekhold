#Transforming Fear into Opportunity: My First Talk

>"*I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain*" - Frank Hurbert

In the weeks leading up to my talk on that stage, my heart raced with fear. The fear of failure, the fear of being inadequate, consumed me. Yet, buried deep inside, there was a flicker of determination&mdash;a drive to conquer this fear, to take on the challenge that had long intimidated me. For years, I had avoided public speaking. It was one of those things I wouldn't dare attempt, fearing embarrassment and judgment. But I knew that if I truly wanted to grow, to become a leader, I couldn't continue to let this fear hold me back. So, I made a conscious decision to confront it head-on. This is the story of how I found the courage to face one of my deepest fears, a fear that had haunted me for as long as I could remember.

As a young boy living on an Island in the northeast Carribbean. I struggled with shyness and a fear of speaking in front of strangers. There was one time I was asked by my math teacher to stand up and give the answer to a geometry question. In that moment, I turned pale, started stuttering, and nervously fidgeted with my fingers-the spotlight was a place I dreaded. Fast forward 10 years to the completion of my graduation internship at Philips, my mentor, Marcel, handed me a parting gift&mdash;a book titled "Speak, Inspire, Empower" by an author called Mark Robinson. Holding the book in my hands, I immediately though, "Miguel, If you want to achieve your goals in life, you need to be able to do this".

Although I hadn't yet had a concrete opportunity to speak in front of others, I was eager to learn and prepare myself for the moment when it inevitably arrived. The prospect of public speaking seemed surprisingly attainable after reading the book. It was time to put theory into practice.

A year later, my company received a nomination for the National Health Innovation Prize, and the need arose for someone to represent us at the event. When my colleagues asked if I would be interested, my initial reaction was one of apprehension. The thought of standing before hundreds of people filled me with dread&mdash;surely, I would embarrass myself. Fear gripped me, and I hesitated, responding with a tentative "I'll think about it."

However, after allowing myself time to reflect, I realized that succumbing to fear would mean squandering a valuable opportunity for growth. I posed a question to myself: "If I were at the end of my life, would I regret letting fear dictate my choices?" All the insights from my reading would be meaningless if I didn't put them into practice. With newfound resolve, I made the decision to step out of my comfort zone and seize the opportunity before me. 

I started to apply everything I learned in the book I received from my mentor. How to structure my talk, my body language, gestures and practice. I took every opportunity to practice. I asked my friends, my family, my colleagues, to watch my talk and to give me their feedback. I practiced hours in front of the mirror, almost every day. But there was something no preperation or book could help me with&mdash;my emotions. The closer I got to the event, the more thoughts I had of self-doubt. Again, the little scared boy from the carribbean was coming out. I started feeling overwhelmed. "Why did I say yes to this? I cannot do it, my pitch is not good enough" I thought. Fear was talking, and I was listening. 

These emotions were extremely strong, eventually it took over me. This wasn't new to me, in fact, I have had other moments in my life where my emotions would take over. I ultimately learned one of the most valuable things I have learned on my journey to learning public speaking

>*"If I knew what you think, I would know what you are, for your thoughts make you what you are. By changing our thoughts, we can change our lives"*.

I started to think positive, "Imagine how it looks like when it all works out, imagine you are announced the winner, imagine people clapping because you delivered such a great pitch". These diverted my natural fear-inducing thoughts to positive ones.

Finally, the day of the event arrived. I walked into the venue, went to the front desk to get my badge, and the familiar thoughts of fear lingered in my mind. But I remembered how to focus on the positive aspects of the experience, I was able to let go of the fear like watching cars passing by on a highway. Soon, we were directed to the main room where the event was to take place. After a few speakers, it was time for the eight nominees, including myself, to take the stage for our pitches. As each person gave their presentation, I couldn't help but feel the nervous energy building up, knowing I would be the last to speak.

The host announced my name, and as I made my way to the center, I thought to myself, "This is a rare opportunity. Six hundred people are about to hear my words. Let's savor it." Taking hold of the microphone and meeting the eyes of the audience, I launched into my pitch. To my delight, it flowed smoothly, and I even caught sight of my pitch coach nodding with approval and offering a thumbs up. With each step I took on the stage, I felt myself relax, embracing the joy of public speakingâ€”a skill I never thought I'd come to enjoy. As I delivered my closing words, the sound of applause filled the room. Surprised and relieved by the positive reception, I found myself approached by several individuals afterward, offering compliments on my performance. What an unforgettable moment!

Conquering my fear of public speaking was more than just a personal triump; it was a journey of self-discovery and empowerment. It taught me that fear is not the enemy but rather a catalyst for growth and transformation. Without fear, how do you develop courage?

>*"I learned that courage was not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it. The brave man is not he who does not feel afraid, but he who conquers that fear."*
